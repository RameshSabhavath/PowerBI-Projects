## 📌Electricity Analytics Dashboard using Power BI
### 🎯 Project Objectives
* *To analyze 231,896 electricity records and identify state-wise, category-wise, and time-based consumption patterns.*
* *To measure statistical dispersion (mean, peak, volatility, anomalies) and detect demand concentration across regions.*
* *To evaluate infrastructure expansion (Capacity) versus actual output (Generation) and environmental impact (Emissions)*.
* *To build an interactive analytical dashboard that transforms raw energy data into decision-support intelligence*.

### 📂 Data Overview & Statistical Foundation      
→ *The dataset contains 32 analytical variables, including: State, Date, Category, Value, YoY %, Moving Averages (3M/6M/12M), Volatility, Lag variables, Demand Index, and Efficiency score.*
### 📊 Core Statistical Results

* *Total Electricity Consumption: 322.49M+ units*
* *Average per Record: 1,414 units*
* *Maximum Spike: 247,580 units  • Minimum: 0 units*
→  *The maximum value is nearly 175× greater than the mean, proving a highly right-skewed distribution, where a small cluster of states and peak periods dominate consumption*.

This confirms electricity demand is structurally concentrated rather than evenly distributed.

### 🗺 State-Wise Findings & Contribution Analysis
🔝 Top Contributors        
→ *Maharashtra: 16.5M+ ┃  Gujarat: 15.9M+ ┃  Tamil Nadu: 13.4M+ ┃  Madhya Pradesh: 12.9M+*         
→ *These four states collectively contribute approximately 18–20% of total national electricity usage, showing strong geographic concentration.*

### 🔻 Low Contributors       
→ *Union territories like Lakshadweep, Goa, and Chandigarh each contribute less than 0.05% individually, reflecting demographic and industrial variation.*

### 📌 Insight       
*Electricity demand is clustered in industrial corridors, increasing localized infrastructure pressure and grid stress risk*.
*The dashboard represents this through state-wise bar charts and map visuals*.

### 📊 Category Wise Structural Analysis

* Capacity: 180M+ units (~56% of structural share)
* Electricity Generation: 74M+ (~23%)
* Power Sector Emissions: 67M+ (~21%)

### 📌 Key Findings

* *Capacity exceeds generation significantly, indicating infrastructure expansion ahead of utilization*.
* *Emissions strongly correlate with generation growth, showing proportional environmental impact*.
* *Structural imbalance suggests potential under-utilization or planning buffer*.

#### Stacked column charts and contribution visuals highlight these relationships.

### 📅 Time Series , Seasonality& Predictive Behavior
🔎 Statistical Behavior

* *Repeating seasonal peaks during summer and industrial quarters.*
* *Moving averages smooth volatility but confirm upward structural trend.*
* *Lag variables show autoregressive behavior (current demand influenced by previous months).*
* *Volatility metrics reveal unstable demand states.*

#### 📌 Interpretation
##### Electricity consumption follows:
→ *Trend + Seasonal Component + Irregular Component*         
→ *This makes the dataset suitable for predictive modeling (AR/SARIMA frameworks).*       
→ *Line charts with trend smoothing in the dashboard demonstrate this clearly.*

### 📉 Volacity, Anomaly & Efficiency Analysis

* *High Z-scores identify statistically significant consumption spikes*.
* *Certain states show higher 3M and 6M volatility, increasing overload risk*.
* *Efficiency scores vary across states, revealing optimization gaps*.

→ *Some high-demand states operate with lower efficiency, creating:*         
→ *High Consumption + Low Efficiency = Economic Leakage.*       
→ *This provides optimization opportunities without immediate infrastructure expansion*.
### 🛠 Dashboard Features

* *Interactive state and category filtering*
* *KPI Cards (Total, Average, Peak, YoY %)*
* *State-wise ranking visuals*
* *Seasonal slicers (Year, Quarter, Season)*
* *Volatility and trend line charts*
* *Category contribution charts*
* *Efficiency benchmarking*

The dashboard converts complex statistical layers into interactive insights.

### ⚠ Business Problem Identified

* *Uneven electricity distribution*
* *Seasonal overload risk*
* *Infrastructure planning uncertainty*
* *Rising emissions with generation growth*
* *Demand unpredictability*
* *Efficiency imbalance*

Traditional static reports cannot capture these multi-dimensional patterns.

### 🚀 How This Project Adds Business Value

* *Enables targeted infrastructure planning instead of uniform investment.*
* *Supports seasonal load forecasting and blackout prevention.*
* *Aligns emission tracking with production growth.*
* *Identifies efficiency gaps for cost reduction.*
* *Reduces systemic risk through volatility monitoring.*

It transforms 231K+ records into actionable intelligence for energy governance.

### 📈 Key Findings & Outcomes
