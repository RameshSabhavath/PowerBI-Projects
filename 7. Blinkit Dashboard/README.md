## 📌  Blinkit Sales Performance & Outlet Optimization Analysis

### 🔷 Project Objectives

* To analyze total sales performance across outlet types, sizes, and city tiers
* To evaluate product category contribution (Fat Content & Item Type)
* To identify high-performing outlet formats and locations
* To support business expansion and inventory planning decisions
* To uncover hidden performance gaps through deep data-level analysis

This project was developed to transform raw transactional sales data into actionable business intelligence insights using structured statistical analysis and dashboard modeling.

### 📊 Data Understanding & Approach

* Dataset contained item-level sales transactions with 12 attributes
* Total Records Analyzed: 8,500+ item entries
* Key Variables Used: Sales, Outlet Type, Outlet Size, Location Tier, Fat Content, Establishment Year

✔ Total Sales Generated: ₹1,201,681.49   
✔ Average Sales per Item: ₹140.99  

Data was grouped and aggregated using category-wise segmentation to calculate percentage contributions and performance weightage.
### 🛠 Tools & Methods Used

◆ Excel (Data Cleaning & Aggregation) 
◆ Power BI (.pbix Dashboard Modeling)       
◆ Statistical Aggregation (Sum, Percentage Contribution, Mean Analysis)  
◆ Category Segmentation        
◆ Trend & Comparative Analysis

### 🏬 Outlet Type Performance Analysis

After aggregating total sales by outlet format:

* Supermarket Type1 contributed 65.54% of total revenue (₹787,549.89)
* Grocery Stores contributed 12.64%
* Supermarket Type2 contributed 10.94%
* Supermarket Type3 contributed 10.88%

### 📌 Insight:
→ Supermarket Type1 alone generates nearly two-thirds of total revenue, making it the primary business driver. Expansion strategy should prioritize this format.

### 📊 Dashboard Insight:
→ Even if Grocery Stores are higher in count, revenue efficiency is significantly lower compared to Supermarket Type1.

### 🌍 Location Tier Performance (State/City Level Impact)

#### Sales distribution across Tier locations:

→ Tier 3 Cities → 39.29% (₹472,133.03)   
→ Tier 2 Cities → 32.72%       
→ Tier 1 Cities → 27.99%          
→ Tier 3 locations outperform Tier 1 in revenue generation.         
→ This indicates higher demand concentration in developing markets rather than metropolitan saturation.       
→ Expansion in Tier 3 & Tier 2 cities offers stronger ROI compared to Tier 1.

### 🏢 Revenue contribution by outlet size:

* Medium Size Outlets → 42.27%
* Small Size Outlets → 37.01%
* High Size Outlets → 20.72%

Medium-sized outlets generate the highest profitability share, indicating optimal cost-to-revenue efficiency.

Large outlets do not proportionally generate high revenue compared to operational costs.

### 🥑 Product Category (Fat Content) Analysis

#### Sales by fat category:

* Low Fat Products → 64.60% of total sales
* Regular Fat Products → 35.40%
* Consumer preference strongly leans toward Low Fat items.
* Inventory strategy should allocate ~65% stock weightage to low-fat products.

This reflects growing health-conscious consumer behavior.

#### 📅 Highest revenue year:

* 2018 outlets generated the highest sales → ₹204,522
* Older outlets (2011) generated lowest → ₹78,131
* Newer outlets show stronger performance due to better location strategy, improved layout, and updated product mix.
* Business Value: Renovating older outlets could improve sales efficiency.

### 📈 Deep Dashboard Insigts (Hidden Patterns Identified)

* Sales concentration is highly skewed — Top outlet type contributes 6x more than smallest
* Revenue gap between Tier 3 and Tier 1 is nearly ₹135,000
* Medium outlets outperform high-size outlets by ₹258,904
* Low Fat products generate ₹350,957 more revenue than Regular products
→ This indicates demand concentration and operational optimization opportunity.
### 💼 Business Problem Solved

##### Before analysis:
* No clarity on which outlet format drives revenue
* No data-backed expansion decision
* Inventory allocation not optimized
* Location performance not quantified

##### After dashboard & analysis:
✔ Identified most profitable outlet format    
✔ Identified high-performing city tiers       
✔ Quantified product demand patterns        
✔ Provided expansion strategy insights       
✔ Delivered category-wise performance metrics

### 🚀Key Outcomes

→ Revenue Optimization Strategy Developed         
→ Tier-based Expansion Recommendation Provided       
→ Product Mix Optimization Identified (65% Low Fat focus)      
→ Outlet Size Profitability Gap Quantified    
→ Data-driven strategic decision framework created

### 🏆 Project Achievements

✔ Converted raw sales data into actionable BI insights       
✔ Improved revenue clarity by 100% through structured KPI modeling        
✔ Identified 65% revenue dependency risk on single outlet format     
✔ Delivered category-wise and location-wise percentage findings    
✔ Created strategic decision-making dashboard for business leaders

### 🎯 Why this Project Matters

→ This project demonstrates how retail data can be transformed into strategic intelligence. Instead of relying on visual dashboards alone, deeper statistical breakdown revealed revenue concentration risks, geographic demand shifts, and product preference trends.     
→ It provides a scalable analytical framework for retail performance monitoring and expansion planning.
